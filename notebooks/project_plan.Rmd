## RSPCA

RSPCA Australia (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) is an Australian organisation established in 1981 to promote animal welfare.

RSPCA Australia defines its purpose as being the leading authority in animal care and protection, and to prevent cruelty to animals by actively promoting their care and protection.


With their mission for animal welfare in mind, this analysis will focus the numbers and type of animal complains RSPCA dealt over the last decade and their outcome. The aim is to point any KPI over time in a suburb, urban and national scale, so to identify focal point of interest for the organisation.

The analysis is aiming to answer these questions:

__• Total call volume for complaint calls: How has this trended over time?__

__• Is there a particular animal being called about the most?__

__• Do particular suburbs have different type of complaint calls? Do they call about different animals?__

__• How have the different outcomes trended over time?__

__• Using the insights found, can we predict how this might look for the upcoming year?__

## Data sources

This data comes from three sources:

• The Open RSPCA database 

• Townsville Animal Complaints 

• Brisbane Open Data - Animal Complaints

The __Open RSPCA database__ contains annual statistics on the numbers of animals received, reclaimed or rehomed. These are compiled on a national basis by RSPCA Australia.

__Townsville Animal Complaints__ lists of grievances received by Townsville City Council from 2013 to 2022 including animal type (cat/dog), complaint type, suburb and local government electoral division. 
Dataset is based on the 6 primary complaint categories of noise, wandering, enclosure, aggressive animal, attack and private impound.

__Brisbane Open Data__ is a report on the total animal related complaints received in a quarter by Brisbane City Council. Information includes basic detail around the nature/type of the complaint and the suburb.

The three data sets are composed in both categorical and numerical variables (i.e. `animal_type` and `total_outcomes`). They all came in .csv file format. 

I don't have found any reason that suggests the data is biased, although it could have been more inclusive, in particular geographically. 

The data sets differ from each other in scale; the RSPCA gives a national view on animal complaints outcomes, while the Townsville and Brisbane are generated by the local authority and cover complaints type and numbers in their respective area.

Although the last two data sets are very useful for a comparison between two different realities (Brisbane is the largest city in Australia and third by population, while Townsville is half the size and has 1/10 of the population), it would have been more insightful to have further data from a similar reality (for example Melbourne to compare with Brisbane and Darwin to compare with Townsville).

I have also noticed that the more prevalent animal types in the data set are dogs and cats, but this could be due more simply by the fact that they are the most popular pets.

The complaints outcome data presents the outcome type, totals and animal type. Would have been interesting if it had included some further info for example the age of the animal to check if it affected the outcome.

## Ethics

Nothing concerning about ethics in the data sets. There no personal information on pet owners or people who started a complain, nor any identification for the pets (i.e. chip number etc.) 

House pets are described generically as `Dogs`, `Cats` and `Other animals`. 

There is no information on breed or background, which if it were the other way around, could have easily led to clickbait tabloid-ish insight like _"most dangerous dog"_ and such, when the reason for collecting the data wasn't certainly this one.

Same applies for non-house pets, we have very generic names: `Livestock`, `Wildlife` and `Horses`.

## Analysis

As mentioned above, the roots of the analysis will be 5 questions:

• Total call volume for complaint calls: How has this trended over time?

• Is there a particular animal being called about the most?

• Do particular suburbs have different type of complaint calls? Do they call about different animals?

• How have the different outcomes trended over time?

• Using the insights found, can we predict how this might look for the upcoming year?

All the process, from data cleaning to data analysis will be done in R Studio. 

The slides for the presentation will be generated in PowerPoint.

The analysis itself will be a Descriptive Analytics on the complaints received by RSPCA in the city of __Brisbane__ and the city of __Townsville__. This part of the analysis will concentrate on the first three questions.

_• Total call volume for complaint calls: How has this trended over time?_

_• Is there a particular animal being called about the most?_

_• Do particular suburbs have different type of complaint calls? Do they call about different animals?_

It will be interesting to point any difference of KPIs in the two locations and if there is any hypothesize why.

The second part of the analysis will be investigating the outcome of complaints on a national scale, analysing the trend over the years.

_•How have the different outcomes trended over time?_

The third and final part will be a Predictive Analytics on the outcome of complaints trend for the next year.

_• Using the insights found, can we predict how this might look for the upcoming year?_

I consider this part as an extension, so it will appear in the final project unless any major issue such as bad time management etc.
